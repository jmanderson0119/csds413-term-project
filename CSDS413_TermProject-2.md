# Term Project Instructions & Rubric

Mehmet Koyutürk, Rui Yang (C) CWRU

The students enrolled in CSDS 413 will conduct a data analysis project throughout the semester. The project teams will identify a question to be answered, develop a hypothesis, and perform data analysis to test their hypothesis and answer the question they pose. The project will be performed in two stages: (1) Project Proposal, (2) Final Presentation. The teams will be composed of up to 3 (if the team is addressing one question with a single hypothesis) or up to 6 (if the team is addressing a question with multiple competing hypotheses, in the form of a debate between subteams) students. Please set up your groups (459 Project Groups on Canvas) no later than Thursday, October 9.

## Stage 1: Project Proposal (20%)

The proposals will be submitted in writing, and the course personnel will provide constructive feedback on the proposals. The teams will execute the project by taking into account the feedback (you do not need to respond to all points that were raised in the feedback or do exactly what the feedback suggested, it will suffice to demonstrate that you are responsive to the feedback suggested; i.e., you considered it and thought about your project further based on the feedback you received.) and deliver their final presentation. The projects will be graded based on significance, completeness, rigor, responsiveness to feedback, and clarity.

All students in a team should submit the same document independently no later than Tuesday, October 28.

## Submission Format & Structure

Submit a PDF file containing the following information:

### For teams with up to 3 students:

- **Title**: Title of the project and names of all team members
- **Research Question**: 1-2 clear sentences
- **Hypothesis**: What do you expect the data to reveal?
- **Dataset(s)**: Source, what it represents, variables, size, number of samples, etc.
- **Execution**: What quantities will you compute from the data to test/support your hypothesis? How will you visualize your results?
- **Validation/Interpretation**: If predicting something, how will you check whether predictions are correct? If checking significance, how will you assess it?
- **Work Plan**: Who is responsible for which part of the project?

### For teams with 4-6 students (debate format):

- **Title**: Title of the project and team list (shared first page)
- **Research Question**: Shared across subteams
- **Subteam Plans**: Each subteam submits a 1-page plan including:
  - Hypothesis (can be shared across subteams)
  - Dataset(s) (can be shared)
  - Planned analysis and methods
  - Validation strategy
  - Role breakdown within the subteam

**Total length**: 2 pages for ≤ 3 students; 3 pages for debate-style teams.

## Topic Ideas

Your project should connect to at least one of the concepts taught in class. You are welcome to explore any domain (e.g., health, finance, education, social media, marketing, sports, etc.) as long as your hypothesis can be addressed using data and statistical analysis. Projects should aim to involve techniques from lecture topics.

## Stage 2: Final Presentation (80%)

The final presentation will be during the final exam slot on Thursday, December 11. The presentation must summarize your complete project process, analysis, and conclusions. No written report is required; your slides and oral presentation are the final deliverables.

### Presentation format

Presentation time slots will be scheduled in advance. Presentation time will depend on team size (see table below). Please submit your slides by 11:59 PM Wednesday, December 10.

**Reserved time for presentations** (including Q&A, please budget as you see fit):

- 6 student team (debate): 24 minutes
- 5 student team (debate): 22 minutes
- 4 student team (debate): 20 minutes
- 3 student team: 16 minutes
- 2 student team: 14 minutes
- 1 student team: 12 minutes

### Recommended Slide Content

Your main slides can clearly and concisely present the following:

- **Title Slide**: Project title and names of all team members
- **Motivation**: Why is this question interesting or important?
- **Research Question & Hypothesis**: Stated clearly, with expected direction
- **Data**: Dataset sources, variables, sample size, and preprocessing steps
- **Methods**: Statistical tests, models, or tools used
- **Results**: Plots, tables, metrics, focus on clarity and interpretation
- **Conclusions**: Answer to your question, supported by evidence
- **Limitations**: Any challenges, uncertainty, or open issues
- **Acknowledgment**: Optional. You may briefly mention any open-source tools or other resources that supported your work.

If your team is structured as a debate (i.e., 4-6 students divided into two subteams with competing hypotheses), your presentation should include content from both perspectives.

You can also include up to the same number of backup slides, which are not to be used during your presentation, but can be used to answer a question during the presentation. The backup slides will also be taken into account during grading, so you can use them to supplement what you show in the presentation (and you can refer to backup slides in your main presentation, e.g., you can include a note like "see Slide 15 for more information").
