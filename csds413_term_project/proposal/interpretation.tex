\section*{Interpretation}

If $ p < 0.05 $, we reject the null hypothesis and interpret the result as evidence that we cannot claim the difference we observed between the ai-generated and human-written textual feature centroids is what we could expect if the linguistic structures of artificial and natural tweets were actually not distinguishable. The implication of this result would be that the AI tweets are not performing well to imitate natural language because differences can be meaningfully identified by a handful of simple attributes.\\

Otherwise, we fail to reject the null hypothesis and must concede that artificial and natural tweets are not distinguishable from these textual features and by proxy their overall linguistic structures. More generally, this would support the idea that AI tweets do well to imitate natural language.
