\section*{Visualization}


We will create the following visualizations to support our analysis:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Permutation test histogram:} Distribution of Mahalanobis distances across 10,000 permutations with observed distance marked, visually representing the p-value.
    
    \item \textbf{Feature comparison box plots:} Side-by-side box plots for each feature (V, S, W, F, C) comparing human vs. AI distributions to identify which features drive group separation.
    
    \item \textbf{PCA scatter plot:} Two-dimensional projection of the five-dimensional feature space, with points colored by tweet type, showing overall group separation.
    

\end{enumerate}

Implementation will use Python's Matplotlib and Seaborn libraries.
