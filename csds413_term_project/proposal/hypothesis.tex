\section*{Hypotheses}




% We hypothesize that that AI-generated tweets exhibit significantly different linguistic and stylistic patters 
% compared to human-written tweets. Specifically, we expect AI-generated tweets to demonstrate:
% \begin{itemize}
%     \item Higher vocabulary richness (V)
%     \item Shorter sentence lengths (S)
%     \item Longer word lengths (W)
%     \item Lower function word frequencies (F)
%     \item Higher capitalization abnormalities (C)
% \end{itemize}

% These differences should be statistically significant and sufficient to build a classification model that distinguishes AI-generated tweets from human-written tweets
% with reasonable accuracy.



$H_0$: There is no significant difference between human-written and AI-generated tweets in their textual feature distributions.

$H_1$: There is a significant difference between human-written and AI-generated tweets in their textual feature distributions.
